Team of about six people working on a lightweight Java application:

- The tools for linting, testing and building will be **Checkstyle**, **JUnit** and **Maven**, respectively.
- **CircleCI** will be used to set up the CI.
- A **cloud** environment is best suited for the CI setup, given the size of the team and the lightweight nature of the project.
